# SpidySallaniyor<br/>
 One of the games I developed while learning unity<br/>

What i learned while developing this game:<br/>

-I learned that I had to put the script name properly(not like SallanOlumUtanma), because I couldn't change it afterwards.<br/>
-I learned to use linerenderer at a not bad level.<br/>
-I learned to calculate angle based on mouse position.<br/>
-I used raycast to control the hit info.<br/>
-I borrowed a code slice from the internet, that states if the mouse is over UI elements.<br/>
-I created a chockpoint system.<br/>
-To use the audio information between scenes, I protected the audio object with the dontdestroyonload() method.<br/>
-And I used playerpref to protect this data when the game is closed.<br/>
-I used instance and singleton pattern.<br/>
-I used class to hold different audio files<br/>
-I also learned how difficult it can be if you don't start the code in a planned way.<br/>
-And I learned little things too, which I decided not to post here because it took so long...<br/>
