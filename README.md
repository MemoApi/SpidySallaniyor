 One of the games I developed while learning unity

What i learned while developing this game:

-I learned that I had to put the script name properly(not like SallanOlumUtanma), because I couldn't change it afterwards.
-I learned to use linerenderer at a not bad level.
-I learned to calculate angle based on mouse position.
-I used raycast to control the hit info.
-I borrowed a code slice from the internet, that states if the mouse is over UI elements.
-I created a chockpoint system.
-To use the audio information between scenes, I protected the audio object with the dontdestroyonload() method.
-And I used playerpref to protect this data when the game is closed.
-I used instance and singleton pattern.
-I used class to hold different audio files
-I also learned how difficult it can be if you don't start the code in a planned way.
-And I learned little things too, which I decided not to post here because it took so long...
